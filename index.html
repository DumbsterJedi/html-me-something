            <p id="introP">We all know it's objectively true that How to Train Your Dragon makes us feel feelings, good ones in fact. But, most people think it's just a story on the screen, that we can't actually experience it in real life. Well i'm here to tell you not just that it's possible to befriend and ride a giant winged dog, but I'll also tell you just how to do it.</p>

                    <h2>Step 1: Riders Don't Pick the Ride, the Ride Picks the Rider</h2>
                    <p>Not many people know that dragons didn't go extinct, they just evolved into the mechanical machines we know as motorcycles. Just like like in the olden days with dragons, befriending their descendants is much the same too. You have to open yourself up to them. Great relationships only form when you make yourself vulnerable, and you're quite vulnerable when hugging a missile at 75mph. </p>

                    <h2>Step 2: You Finally Have an Excuse to Wear Armor</h2>
                    <p>Obviously riding dragons and motorcycles are inherently dangerous. The best way to protect yourself and your ride from your foes is to gear up. Just like Hiccup wore armor to protect himself from mind-controlled dragons and psychopaths, you should do the same, except you're protecting yourself from cars, fence-posts, and psychopaths. The only thing to add to Hiccups attire is a helmet with a face shield, because apparently bugs didn't exist back then. </p>

                    <h2>Step 3: Sever Your Leg Please, Sir</h2>
                    <p>Hiccup fixing Toothless's tail is no different than you fixing your own friend. Don't let anyone fix them for you because repair time is bonding time. If you take care of your bike, it'll take care of you, just like Toothless saved hiccup from loosing more than a leg. Whoever says "You can change a tire, but a tire can't change you", doesn't know anything about tires, or dragons...or motorcycles, or...you know what I mean. </p>

                    <h2>Step 4: In Vin Diesel's muffled voice, "It's about family".</h2>
                    <p>Just like Hiccup had his squad of dragon pilots to fight the deathstar equivalent of a dragon, you need to find your own squad to fight the deathstar equivalent of depression and existential dread. We are relational beings, so finding a group of people who share this relationship with machines will keep your head in the clouds. Just don't try to blow anything up or steal any vaults with them. Fast and Furious morals might be a reality, but the physics definitely aren't. </p>

                    <h2>Step 5: Burninate</h2>
                    <p>Don't ask me why, I don't understand the nuances of the evolutionary process, but the descendants of dragons stopped being able to fly since their wings turned into wheels. Because of this, we miss a crucial part of sustaining this relationship; flying through the clouds. Luckily, this tradeoff gives them the ability to make their own clouds here on the ground. So make sure to do burnouts relatively often to stay bonded.</p>
