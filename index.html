                <h1>How to How to Train Your Dragon</h1>
                <h6><em>(no it's not a typo)</em></h6> 
                <p id="introP">We all know it's objectively true that How to Train Your Dragon makes us feel feelings, good ones in fact. But, most people think it's just a story on the screen, that we can't actually experience it in real life. Well i'm here to tell you not just that it's possible to to befriend and ride a giant winged dog and form an ubreakable bond, but I'll also tell you just how to do it.</p>

            <div class="step"> 
                <img src="/images/Taming the beast.jpg" alt="Make friends">
                <h2>Step 1: Befriend the creature</h2>
                <p>Not many people know that dragons didn't go extinct, they just evolved into the mechanical machines we know as motorcycles. Just like like in the olden days with dragons, befriending their decendants is much the same. </p>

            <div class="step">
                <img src="/images/Armor.jpg" alt="Armor">
                <h2>Step 2: Protect Yourself</h2>
                <p>As you and your new friend get to know each other, you're going to make some mistakes. Get some protective gear to keep you safe not just as you test each other's limits, but also to keep you safe from the outside world. Wearing a helmet is the best way to keep bugs and birds from dying on your face as you enjoy your ride together.  </p>

                <img src="/images/severYourLeg.jpg" alt="Maintenece">
                <h2>Step 3: Sever Your Leg Please, Sir</h2>
                <p>Just figuratively of course. Hiccup fixed Toothless's tail to keep him in the air, and Toothless kept Hiccup from losing more than just his leg. We need to do the same with our mechanical friends. Fixing and maintaing your bike will teach you about yourself and your ride. If you take care of your bike, it'll take care of you. Whoever said "You can change a tire, but a tire can't change you", doesn't know anything about tires, or dragons...or motorcycles, or whatever. </p>

            <div class="step">
                <img src="/images/squadhttyd.jpg" alt="Family">
                <h2>Step 4: Find Your Viking Family</h2>
                <p>As Vin Diesel's famous line goes, "It's about family", which is true of course. </p>

            <div class="step">
                <img src="/images/MakingClouds.jpg" alt="Burn Rubber">
                <h2>Step 5: Burninate</h2>
                <p>Don't ask me why, I don't understand the nuances of the evolutionary process, but the decendants of dragons stopped being able to fly. Because of this, we miss a crucial part of sustaining this relationship; flying through the clouds. Luckily, motorcycles have the ablity to make their own clouds here on the ground. So make sure to do burnouts relatively often.</p>
